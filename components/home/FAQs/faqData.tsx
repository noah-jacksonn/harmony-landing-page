        While the list would be too long to name in full, here are a few ways Harmony has supported
        people: healing traumas and processing upsetting past experiences, navigating tough life
        situations, managing stress and anxiety, gaining clarity around difficult decisions,
        connecting with their Self and parts, personal development, and working <em>with</em> the
        full spectrum of emotions to find more balance and harmony.

        Harmony should not be used for medical diagnoses, treatment, or prescribing medication, nor
        should it be used for medical advice. Additionally, if you&apos;re in a severe or immediate crisis, please
        reach out to a human professional (we know reaching out is incredibly hard, but{" "}

        We know how important it is to have a safe space where you actually feel comfortable during
        therapy. One of our main aims in Harmony is creating a non-judgmental, safe environment for
        our members. So we only use the data needed to make the core functionalities work and
        nothing more (

        Many of our members find Harmony works great alongside their regular therapy, due to its
        24/7 availability between sessions. Harmony is also designed for those who&apos;ve never
        stepped foot in a therapist&apos;s officeâ€”no prior experience required.
